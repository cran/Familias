\title{
Calculates a prior distribution for a list of pedigrees
}
\description{
By default the same prior probability is assigned to all pedigrees in the list, 
but this can be adjusted with the function parameters. It is computed which 
persons are common to all the pedigrees listed, and they are handled in a 
special way: It is with relation to these persons that the number of generations
and other parameters are computed. Also, the function will search for and remove
pedigrees that are "equivalent" in terms of representing the relationship 
between these core persons. So if another pedigree is added, with all new 
persons, the function will return with an error message.

\usage{
FamiliasPrior(pedigrees, 
              generationsParameter = 1, 
              inbreedingParameter = 1, 
              partnerParameter = 1, 
              maxGenerations)

%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{pedigrees}{
A list of objects of class either 'pedigree' or 'FamiliasPedigree'.
}
  \item{generationsParameter}{
Non-negative real. A value of 1 indicates no influence of the parameter. A value
above 1 (below 1) increases (decreases) the prior probability for pedigrees with
many generations.
}
  \item{inbreedingParameter}{
Non-negative real. A pedigree is inbred if parents are related within the 
pedigree. If 0, all inbred pedigrees are assigned a prior probability 0. A value
of 1 indicates no influence of inbreeding. A value above 1 (below 1) increases
(decreases) the prior for inbred pedigrees.
}
  \item{partnerParameter}{
Non-negative real (previously referred to as promiscuity parameter). If 0, all 
pedigrees where parents have children by different partners, are assigned prior 
0. A value of 1 indicates no influence of the parameter. A value above 1 (below
1) increases (decreases) the prior for partners having children by different 
partners. 
}
  \item{maxGenerations}{
Integer giving the maximum number of generations; pedigrees with more 
generations than this are assigned a zero prior probability. 
}

parametric models implemented.

\value{
The prior, i.e., a vector of real numbers summing to 1.
