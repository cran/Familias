\title{
A list of markers with allele names and frequencies 
}
\description{
The information represents allele frequencies for a range of different markers based on 
a data base in Norway. 
}
\usage{
data(NorwegianFrequencies)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\format{
A list with named components, with names corresponding to the names of the loci. 
Each component is a vector of frequencies, with the names attribute of the vector 
equal to the names of the alleles.
